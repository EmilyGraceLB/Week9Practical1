## Stage 1: Vite project
### Pre-requisite (personal computers only, skip if using an LMB/008 computer!)
[Download and install Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en). To verify that it has installed correctly, open up the command line ([Mac](https://support.apple.com/en-gb/guide/terminal/apd5265185d-f365-44cb-8b09-71a064a42125/mac) | [Windows](https://www.lifewire.com/how-to-open-command-prompt-2618089) | [Linux](https://ubuntu.com/tutorials/command-line-for-beginners#1-overview)) and run:

```node -v```

If you see a version number, e.g. v20.5.0, Node has installed correctly. If you see anything else, installation has failed. Seek help!
